## üöÄ QUICK START - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. Go to **https://formspree.io**
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card needed)
3. Create a new form
4. Set the email to: `joeyromaine+websiteform1@pm.me`
5. Copy the form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/abc123xyz`)
6. Open `index.html` in a text editor
7. Find this line (around line 141):
   ```html
   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
8. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
9. Save the file

**That's it!** Your contact form will now work.

### 2. Add Your Social Media Handles

Update these placeholders in the following pages:

**Photography Page (photography.html):**
- Line ~90: Replace `YOUR_HANDLE` with your Instagram photography handle
